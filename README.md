There are mainly two classes the Matrix class and the Determinante class. 
The Determinante is derived from Matrix and implements a better way of 
calcualating the Determinant. 
Several Matrix opertations are implemented. 

Run test main as follows:

In folder MatrixCalculator do the following:

g++ -std=c++14 Source/*.cpp -I./Header/ -o MatrixCalculator.exe

./MatrixCalculator.exe

should then give you the example outputs. 

The Matrix class can do inversion, cholesky, determinant, covariance matrix and so on. 
I will add some more comments as we go.
